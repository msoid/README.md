**hello** 

My name is Tommy Bauer and I am in tenth grade.

I have four pets; two cats named **Kitcat** and **Little Dunebuggy**, and two geckos named **(Eric) Cartman** and **Evil Jason.**

I want to be a pharmaceutical chemist when I am older, which includes creating medicine and studying the chemistry of pharmaceuticals.

Some interests of mine are both organic and inorganic chemistry, biology, astronomy, herpetology, __computer science__, music __(TOOL, Nine Inch Nails, Smashing Pumpkins,  etc.)__
